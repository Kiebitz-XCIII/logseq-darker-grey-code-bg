I like [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq), but not the default dark theme. (Solarized?) Simply switching the accent color to anything but "Logseq classical color" (I like "blue color".) helps a lot but still made me want to adjust the background colors of inline code, code blocks and tables. That's what this `custom.css` does along with some text colors to better fit the background adjustments.
